# TodeTode

language of todes that live in mountains

## Notes

Unlike [the original TodeTode](https://github.com/TodePond/TodeTode) (which I'll call Todelang from now on),
this version was designed to be slightly more human-readable,
with the lore being that a machine crashed down from the sky and the Todes there have been trying to communicate it ever since.
